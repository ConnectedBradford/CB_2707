# CB_2707 Healthy Urban Places (HUP-North)

Healthy Urban Places (HUP-North) is a systems approach research project that aims to understand how to harness the power of local places to improve population health and reduce inequalities, using evidence from two cities in the North of England (i.e. Bradford and Liverpool) both of which with high levels of deprivation and poor health. This research project is built upon four parallel interdisciplinary work-packages (WPs) to explore the following four research questions: 
* WP1 How can we identify and measure what makes a healthy place? 
* WP2 What features of our environment are most important for protecting or harming health and what are the mechanisms behind their impact? 
* WP3 How can we improve the evidence base evaluating the impacts of place-based interventions and natural experiments on health and inequalities to inform policy? 
* WP4 How can we demonstrate the long-term health and economic impact of policies to make local places healthier?
